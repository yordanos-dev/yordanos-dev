     <h3>I LIKE ME </h3>
    <h6>
    “I like me. I’ve liked me for a very long time. For a long time I’ve had a very good relationship with myself. 
    <br> You’ve gotta work to get to that place. If you’re going out in the world and you don’t know who you are <br>
    and you don’t know what you want you don’t know how much you’re worth, then you have to be brave <br>
    and you have to count on the kindness and goodness of others to bestow that goodness on you when you should be <br>
    working to get it on your own because you deserve it." ~Dr. Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama:</h6>

    <h3>EAT</h3>
    <h6>
    Eat. I am not going to tell you what, when or how much too eat. No one can. We all need to eat. Everybody is different <br>
        and our needs change at different stages of our lives. Think about your relationship with food. Is your relationship healthy?  <br>
        Please eat. Enjoy. How and what you think about food changes and greatly effects your relationship. Food is your friend <br> and life partner.
       Work on having an honest, balanced, stress-free and healthy.

 <h3>PLAY</h3>
   <h6> Find time each day to play. Our lives are meant to be filled with joy. Create your own fun. Learn to play and have fun, <br>
       it comes to us naturally. Or at least it usto when we were children. Make a plan to play. Do something you enjoy. Spend time with <br> 
       someone that makes you smile, make someone laugh. Do something that you enjoy, something that relaxes you or excites you. <br> 
       Everyday. Don’t wait till later, tomorrow or next year. Enjoy now NOW. </h6>
